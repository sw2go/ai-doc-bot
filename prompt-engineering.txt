Prompt engineering tips
-----------------------

1. Text completion
------------------

Remember always it is "text completion", write the prompt logically to support the flow of text leading to the answer.

That's the reason why prompts start with general info and then have more and more concrete info toward the end.
Often the prompts ending ist the beginning of the answer.
Sample 1: Frage: {question} Folgefrage:"
Sample 2: Kontext: {context} Antworte in Markdown:"

2. Order matters
----------------

Order of question and context can have a impact how the bot acts.
   
question first, context second: 
- This makes the bot more likely to see itself as a third person, describing what is in the context
- Der Bot sagt: "die Firma ist spezialisert auf Softwareentwicklung"

context first, question second: 
- This makes the bot more likely to see itself knowing or beeing what is described in the context
- Der Bot sagt: "ich bin spezialisert auf Softwareentwicklung"

Try questions like: who is me? who are you? who is they? what can you do?
